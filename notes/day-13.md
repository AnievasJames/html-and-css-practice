Day-13

I learned how to use positions and background images.

I did not code anything about positions since it was only an introduction about it but I'll definitely use it in the future.

On background images, unlike before, I will adjust the height and width of the image first just to make it fit to be the background of my website. But upon learning the different "background-" css codes, it is much easier to do it now.
