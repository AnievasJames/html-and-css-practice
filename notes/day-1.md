Day 1

I decided to start practicing my html and css again for the second time after failing to stay committed last year.

I started with my first "!", luckily on vscode, wait... actually i don't know with the other code editors but doing a "!" on vscode gives you the complete template for the Doctype.

Doing all of this while watching LearnCode.academy, it was very helpful and gave me a huge excitement while learning the basics.

Started using headings and paragraphs.
