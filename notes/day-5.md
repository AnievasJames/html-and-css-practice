Day 5

- Day 4 was only a few hours ago and I'm still currently working on our finals week but I decided to take a short break and practice again for a little.

- I decided to challenge myself and looked for a website providing beginner friendly html and css challenges.

- Here's the activity: 
Create a tribute page
Choose a historical figure who’s meaningful to you 
and create a webpage dedicated to them. The webpage 
should include:

A title or heading with the person’s name
An image of the person
A caption for the image
A timeline of the person’s life in the form of a list

- At first it was easy since I was just writing headings, paragraphs and some unordered lists

- But it looked very basic and plain so here comes spending a lot of time with the css, bringing all of my contents on the center

- Using divs again to text-align center the contents.

- I started becoming more familiar with the box model, what are the good box-sizing, margins and paddings.

- Became aware that different websites have different box models and from that point, I realized that the box model of a website is a huge factor on how you want your website to look like

- I immediately thought of different designs on my head so I think for the upcoming days, i will focus on box models.
