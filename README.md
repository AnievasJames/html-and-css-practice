My Daily HTML/CSS Practice

I started practicing HTML/CSS on November 2, 2025. Four days later, I decided to start using Git and GitHub. On November 5, I noticed my practice was becoming inconsistent, especially with finals week in college. Even 10–20 minutes a day matters to me, so to stay motivated, I decided to record my progress on GitHub. Today (Nov 6) is my first real day using it after having the account for years.
